## THE ENTITY

CPSC 233 Tutorial 02 Team 6 project Final Version. This is the *finished* graphical version. The player will move up, down, left, and right, to find keys, avoid enemies/projectiles, and escape the school before their life runs out. 

## Getting Started
In order to run this program for development, download the files from our github repository and add them to your workspace. After this, simply import the project. We used eclipse, and as such we recommend the same. Steps to do this are listed below.

## Prerequisites
The following are required to install this game:

 - Access to a computer
 - Access to github (our github link: [https://github.com/Widget-Hub/team_6_project)
 - Eclipse IDE (available at eclipse.org)
 - Java version 8 (available at oracle.com)

## Compile and Run

 1. Grab the project out of the repo listed above. It is named "**GUIVersion**"
 2. Open your installation of Eclipse
 3. Open the file explorer and copy and paste the project to your workspace. If using default settings, this will be in the following: Local Disk > Users > "*your account name*" > eclipse-workspace
 4. Go to Eclipse, and open projects from file system from the file menu
 5. Find the project in the eclipse-workspace folder mentioned above
 6. The folder will now be in the navigator
 7. Click the *down arrow* beside the project you selected
 8. You will see a *src* folder, click the down arrow beside it
 9. You can now see every class and review the code
 10. To run, simply select the project (left click) hit the "Run" button in the top bar of Eclipse (be sure all res files are available)
 11. To close, hit the **X** on the window  

## Running Tests
The Junit test is still being worked on. When this is available, more will be added here.
We will test the camera class of the project.
To run the test:

 1. Add the test class to the project
 2. Right click the class
 3. Hit run as Junit test
 4. The class 'Camera' should have now ran as a test, and shown any test fails and errors
