## THE ENTITY

CPSC 233 Tutorial 02 Team 6 project Demo 1. This is the text based version of our game. It's a game in which you move room to room and read notes to get hints at what happened and how to get out. Finding the exit is the goal of the game.

## Getting Started
In order to run this program for development, download the files from our github repository and add them to your workspace. After this, simply import the project. We used eclipse, and as such we recommend the same.

## Prerequisites
The following are required to install this game:

 - Access to a computer
 - Access to github (our github link: [https://github.com/Widget-Hub/team_6_project)
 - A text editor that can edit and run the program (ex: eclipse, available at eclipse.org)
 - Java version 8 (available at oracle.com)

## Running Tests
when this is available, more will be added here.
To test the program without a test file, run it and use the 'a' and 'd' keys to test it. This will test the switch() used to get the input from the user.

## Contributions
Team members: Bobby, Kay, Aiyo, Chuks, Aly

## Versioning
Current version 1.0.0


## Acknowledgments
We realize that the code is incomplete, and there will be future updates.
