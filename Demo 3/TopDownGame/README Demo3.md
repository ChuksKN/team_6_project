## THE ENTITY

CPSC 233 Tutorial 02 Team 6 project Demo 3. This is the *unfinished* graphical version. The player will move up, down, left, and right, to find objects and escape the rooms. Some art assets have been added. 

## Getting Started
In order to run this program for development, download the files from our github repository and add them to your workspace. After this, simply import the project. We used eclipse, and as such we recommend the same. Steps to do this are listed below.

## Prerequisites
The following are required to install this game:

 - Access to a computer
 - Access to github (our github link: [https://github.com/Widget-Hub/team_6_project)
 - A text editor that can edit and run the program (ex: eclipse, available at eclipse.org)
 - Java version 8 (available at oracle.com)

## Compile and Run

 1. Grab the project out of the repo listed above. It is named "Demo 2"
 2. Open your installation of Eclipse
 3. Open the file explorer and copy and paste the project to your workspace. If using default settings, this will be in the following: Local Disk > Users > "your account name" > eclipse-workspace
 4. Go to Eclipse, and open projects from file system from the file menu
 5. Find the project in the eclipse-workspace folder mentioned above
 6. The folder will now be in the navigator
 7. Click the *down arrow* beside the project you selected
 8. You will see a *src* folder, click the down arrow beside it
 9. You can now see every class and review the code
 10. To run, simply hit the run button in the top bar (be sure the res files are there as well, otherwise a blank window will pop up)
 11. To close, hit the *X* on the window  

## Running Tests
The Junit test is still being worked on. When this is available, more will be added here.
We will test the camera class of the project.
To run the test:

 1. Add the test class to the project
 2. Right click the class
 3. Hit run as Junit test
 4. The class 'Camera' should have now ran as a test, and shown any test fails and errors

## Acknowledgments
We realize that the code is incomplete, and there will be 1 more future update to complete it. The code is running now with a few art assets being used, we have to add in more art assets, and a bigger map. A start menu is also close to being completed and added.
Thanks to anyone who has provided help.
